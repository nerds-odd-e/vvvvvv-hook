Since it's SDL2 I have to match how they create the d3d device.
https://github.com/zielmicha/SDL2/blob/master/src/render/direct3d/SDL_render_d3d.c#L535

Big issue is that we get attached before the window is created, so we have to wait.

Fixed with new hooking code.

Game has a way to set the framerate to 30fps which based on the source code does not wait for events
But if a game does this we might have to hook the SDL_PollEvent code

xx Intro

I love playing games, been playing them since I was a kid.

Later in life I learned how to program, so I've always thought about, how can I best combine these two things.

What I ended up doing is working in the gaming industry for 7 years, working on many aspects of game development (except making a game, but that's a talk for another day)

But what I found interesting is to create tools that would play games for me.

There are actually a lot of interesting technical considerations here so I hope you can get something out of this even if you don't play games.

xx Explain Speedrunning

xx Explain TAS speedrunning

xx Show Bejeweled 3 tool I made (perhaps also the triangle game)

xx Talk about the pros and cons of developing a tool like that

xx Show a game that does this via slowdowns (perhaps Trackmania)

xx Talk about the pros and cons on the slowdown version

xx Show how Doom 1993 does this, Demo files, deterministic RNG

xx Show it in code using the patricia doom repo, pros and cons, etc

xx Show VVVVVV, how it works, etc.

xx Show the game being played by the tool.

xx Explain the tool, problems in making it, pros cons, etc
